## Customization

### Colors
The main color scheme uses teal accents on a dark background. To customize:

- Background: `#0a1f1f` (main) and `#0d2626` (cards)
- Accent: `#14b8a6` (teal-400 to teal-600)
- Text: White, gray-100, gray-400

You can modify these in the Tailwind classes throughout the components.

### Data Source

The app intelligently switches between mock data and real API data:

- **Development Mode**: Uses mock data if backend is unavailable
- **Production Mode**: Fetches real data from your Express backend
- **Automatic Fallback**: If the API is down, it automatically uses mock data

To connect to GoHighLevel:
1. Follow the setup guide in `WEBHOOK_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
2. Configure webhooks in your GHL account
3. Data flows automatically into your dashboard!

### Webhook Integration

The backend receives data from GoHighLevel and stores it in MongoDB:

```
GHL â†’ Webhook â†’ Express Server â†’ MongoDB â†’ React Dashboard
```

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/webhooks/ghl-call`

See `server/README.md` for API documentation.
