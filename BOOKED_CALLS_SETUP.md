# Booked Calls Display Setup Complete! 🎉

## What Was Done

I've successfully created a complete **Booked Calls Webhook System** that receives appointment data and displays it beautifully on your dashboard! Here's everything that was built:

---

## ✅ Complete Implementation

### 1. **Backend - Database Model** (`server/models/BookedCall.js`)
Created a comprehensive MongoDB schema that stores:
- ✅ **Contact Information**: Full name, email, phone, tags, country, timezone
- ✅ **Location Details**: Business address, city, state, postal code
- ✅ **User Assignment**: First name, last name, email of assigned user
- ✅ **Calendar/Appointment Data**: 
  - Appointment ID, title, start/end times
  - Status (booked, confirmed, cancelled)
  - Meeting link/address
  - Calendar name and timezone
- ✅ **Workflow Info**: Workflow ID and name
- ✅ **Custom Data**: Formatted appointment details
- ✅ **Timestamps**: Auto-tracks when records are created/updated

### 2. **Backend - API Routes** (`server/routes/webhooks.js`)

#### POST Route - Webhook Receiver
- ✅ Endpoint: `POST /api/webhooks/booked-call-created`
- ✅ Receives webhook data from your booking system
- ✅ Maps all nested data (location, user, calendar, workflow)
- ✅ Prevents duplicates using appointment ID
- ✅ Updates existing records if appointment changes
- ✅ Always returns 200 status to prevent retries

#### GET Route - Data Fetcher
- ✅ Endpoint: `GET /api/webhooks/booked-calls`
- ✅ Fetches recent appointments sorted by start time
- ✅ Supports limit parameter (default: 10 records)

### 3. **Frontend - API Function** (`src/lib/api.js`)
- ✅ Added `fetchBookedCalls()` function
- ✅ Fetches appointments from backend
- ✅ Error handling included

### 4. **Frontend - Display Component** (`src/components/dashboard/RecentBookedCallsTable.jsx`)

Beautiful table showing:
- ✅ **Appointment Details**: Calendar name, title, meeting link
- ✅ **Contact Info**: Name, email, phone with icons
- ✅ **Schedule**: Date, time, timezone, duration (auto-calculated!)
- ✅ **Status Badges**: Color-coded (green=booked, blue=confirmed, red=cancelled)
- ✅ **Assignment**: Who the appointment is assigned to
- ✅ **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects for each row
- ✅ **Clickable Meeting Links**: Join video calls directly
- ✅ **Empty State**: Shows friendly message when no appointments

### 5. **Frontend - Dashboard Integration** (`src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)
- ✅ Imported component
- ✅ Added query with auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ✅ Placed display after EOCs section
- ✅ Added gradient section header

### 6. **Server Configuration** (`server/server.js`)
- ✅ Updated endpoint documentation
- ✅ Added startup message showing webhook URL

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Restart Your Server
```powershell
cd server
npm start
```

You should see:
```
📅 Booked Call Webhook: http://localhost:5000/api/webhooks/booked-call-created
```

### Step 2: Start Your Frontend
```powershell
# In the main project folder
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: View Your Dashboard
- Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
- Look for **"Recent Booked Appointments"** section
- It appears right after the EOCs section

## 📊 What You'll See

The booked calls display shows a comprehensive table with:

| Column | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| **Appointment** | Calendar name, appointment title, meeting link (clickable) |
| **Contact** | Full name, email, phone number |
| **Scheduled For** | Date & time with timezone |
| **Duration** | Auto-calculated (e.g., "45 min") |
| **Status** | Color-coded badge (booked/confirmed/cancelled) |
| **Assigned To** | User name and email |

### Status Badges:
- 🟢 **Green** = Booked or Confirmed
- 🔵 **Blue** = Confirmed
- 🔴 **Red** = Cancelled
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Rescheduled
- ⚪ **Gray** = Pending

---

## 🔄 Auto-Refresh
The booked calls display automatically refreshes every **30 seconds** to show the latest appointments!

---

## 📝 Webhook URL

### For Development:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/webhooks/booked-call-created
```

### For Production (replace with your domain):
```
https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/booked-call-created
```

## 📋 Expected Webhook Data Structure

Your webhook should send data in this format:

```json
{
  "Full Name": "John Doe",
  "Email": "john@example.com",
  "Phone": "+1234567890",
  "Tags": "vip,consultation",
  "Country": "US",
  "Timezone": "America/New_York",
  "Date Created": "2025-10-15T18:44:43.101Z",
  "Contact Source": "Website",
  "location": {
    "Location Name": "Office",
    "Location Address": "123 Main St",
    "Location City": "New York",
    "Location State": "NY"
  },
  "user": {
    "User First Name": "Jane",
    "User Last Name": "Smith",
    "User Email": "jane@example.com"
  },
  "calendar": {
    "Calendar Title": "Consultation Call",
    "Calendar Appointment Id": "abc123",
    "Calendar Start Time": "2025-10-16T18:00:00",
    "Calendar End Time": "2025-10-16T18:45:00",
    "Calendar Status": "booked",
    "Calendar Appoinment Status": "confirmed",
    "Calendar Address": "https://meet.google.com/...",
    "Calendar Calendar Name": "Sales Calls"
  },
  "workflow": {
    "Workflow ID": "workflow-123",
    "Workflow Name": "Booking Workflow"
  },
  "customData": {
    "Custom Data App Date": "Thursday, October 16, 2025 3:00 PM",
    "Custom Data App Title": "Sales Call",

## 🎨 Design Features

The booked calls table:
- ✨ Professional table layout
- 🎯 Hover effects on rows
- 📱 Responsive design (scrolls horizontally on mobile)
- 🌙 Dark theme with teal accents
- 💎 Glassmorphism effect (backdrop blur)
- 🔗 Clickable meeting links with icons
- ⏰ Auto-calculates appointment duration
- 📅 Human-readable date/time formatting
- 🔢 Shows appointment count in header

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If booked calls don't appear:
1. ✅ Server running on port 5000?
2. ✅ MongoDB connected?
3. ✅ Webhook sending to correct endpoint?
4. ✅ Check browser console (F12) for errors
5. ✅ Check server logs for webhook receipt

### If webhook fails:
- Verify all top-level fields are present
- Nested objects (location, user, calendar) can be missing
- Check server logs for specific error messages
- Test with sample data using Postman/curl

### Test Command (PowerShell):
```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/webhooks/booked-call-created `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{\"Full Name\":\"Test User\",\"Email\":\"test@example.com\",\"calendar\":{\"Calendar Start Time\":\"2025-10-20T15:00:00\",\"Calendar End Time\":\"2025-10-20T16:00:00\",\"Calendar Appoinment Status\":\"confirmed\"}}'
```
