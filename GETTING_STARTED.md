## Understanding the Files

### Important Folders:

### Key Files:

- **src/main.jsx**: Entry point of the application
- **tailwind.config.js**: Styling configuration
- **vite.config.js**: Build tool configuration

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Port already in use
**Solution**: The server might already be running. Check for other terminal windows or restart your computer.

### Issue: Changes not showing
**Solution**: 
1. Save the file
2. Refresh your browser (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: npm install fails
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Check your internet connection
3. Delete `node_modules` folder and try again

## Need Help?

- Check the main **README.md** for more technical details
- Review the code comments in the files
- Search for specific React, Tailwind CSS, or Vite documentation online

## Advanced: Connecting to Real Data (GHL Webhooks)

Your dashboard currently uses **mock data** (fake test data). To connect it to real data from GoHighLevel:

### Quick Overview
1. Set up MongoDB database (free cloud database)
2. Start the backend server (receives webhooks)
3. Configure GoHighLevel to send webhooks
4. Data flows automatically into your dashboard!

### Detailed Instructions
See the **WEBHOOK_SETUP_GUIDE.md** file for complete step-by-step instructions.

This includes:
- Setting up MongoDB (free)
- Starting the backend server
- Configuring GHL webhooks
- Testing the connection
- Troubleshooting tips

**Note:** The webhook setup is optional. Your dashboard works great with mock data for development and testing!
